the lazy, no-good son of a noble family had turned up at the training hall. Evidently, he’d been disowned by his father in the wake of a fight and would be studying the sword while sleeping at the hall.

Paul had also studied swordsmanship at home, so despite having practiced a different style, it wasn’t long before his abilities surpassed Lilia’s. She was less than amused by that, but in retrospect, she’d never had a knack for it in the first place.

Paul, on the other hand, positively radiated talent. One day, however, he abruptly left the training hall after causing some kind of big stir for reasons unknown to Lilia. He left with one final declaration: “I’m going to become an adventurer.”

The man was like a hurricane.

It had been seven years since Lilia had last seen Paul. And not only had he become a knight since then, but now he was also married? Lilia could scarcely believe it. She didn’t know what ups and downs he had been through, but if he was still the man she remembered, then he wasn’t a bad fellow at all. If he knew she was in trouble, he’d probably help her out.

And if he didn’t… well, she’d just have to dredge up some stuff from the past. She had several stories up her sleeve to use as bargaining chips if she needed to. Having done that bit of mercenary calculus in her mind, Lilia headed for Buena Village.

Paul welcomed Lilia with open arms. His wife, Zenith, was due soon, and the couple was quite frazzled. Lilia had the essential technical know-how from seeing to the birth and rearing of the princess; plus, she was a familiar face that one of them could vouch for. The family was happy to have her aboard.

Also, the pay was better than Lilia had been hoping for. To her, it was like a dream come true.

And then the child was born.

The birth itself was problem-free, with everything proceeding as it should according to Lilia’s training. Even at the junctures where one could typically expect complications, everything went smoothly.

But once he was born, the child did not cry. Lilia broke into a cold sweat. The infant’s face was expressionless, his nose and mouth having expelled amniotic fluid, and he made no sound. For a moment, he looked like he might have been stillborn. But when Lilia reached out, she could feel the baby’s warm pulse and the movements of his breathing.

Still, he did not cry. Lilia remembered something she’d heard from one of the handmaidens who’d taught her: Children who didn’t cry at birth tended to have a host of abnormalities.

At that very instant, however, her thoughts were interrupted.

“Ahh! Waah!”

The baby turned his face toward Lilia, his expression slack, burbling random sounds. Relief washed over Lilia.

She didn’t quite know why, but it seemed like things were going to be okay.

The child was given the name Rudeus, and what an unsettling child he was. He never cried, and never made a fuss. It might just have been that he was physically frail, but that notion was soon proven false. Once Rudeus learned to crawl, he began to make his way anywhere and everywhere around the house—the kitchen, the back door, the supply shed, the cleaning closet, the fireplace, and so on. Sometimes, somehow, he even made his way to the second floor. As soon as anyone took their eyes off him, he was gone.

Regardless, he would inevitably be found within the house. For some reason, Rudeus never ventured outside. He’d look out the windows, but perhaps he was still too scared to leave the house.

Lilia wasn’t sure when she developed an instinctual fear of the child. Was it around then, with him slipping away whenever unobserved, always needing to be tracked down?

Rudeus was always smiling. Whether he was in the kitchen staring at vegetables, or at the flickering of a candle in its holder, or at unwashed undergarments, he was always burbling under his breath, chuckling as an unsettling grin rose to his face.

It was the kind of grin that viscerally repulsed Lilia. It reminded her of the smiles she’d gotten from a particular cabinet minister as she made her way between the harem and the royal palace in the past. He was a bald man, his smooth head gleaming in the sunlight and his corpulent belly wobbling as he walked. Rudeus’s smile resembled the grin on the minister’s face when he eyed Lilia’s chest. A smile like that, coming from a mere baby.

What happened when Lilia picked Rudeus up was particularly worrisome. His nostrils flared, the corners of his mouth drew up, and he’d start panting and bury his face against her bosom. His throat would twitch as he made weird, gleeful little giggles.

It was enough to send a chill down Lilia’s spine; she almost wanted to hurl the boy to the floor in reflex.
