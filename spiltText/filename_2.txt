to ask you something. That... Although it's a small thing, is it hard for Ayana to have a good relationship with horibai? "



" it's not so good, ordinary, ordinary. What happened to that guy? "



it seems that horibai is not so much for me as for her purpose. A little sad.



"Ah Uh huh. That... Don't I want to get better with my classmates? So I'm asking the contact way one by one. But... He was rejected by his classmates. "



that guy is too wasteful. Since there is such a positive person, it's not good to contact her by the way. In this way, you may be able to integrate into the class by accident.



"Did you talk in front of the school on the day of the entrance ceremony? "



thinking that we are on the same bus, she will see my meeting with horibai, which is not surprising.



"What is Horie's personality? Is it someone who can speak all kinds of things in front of friends? "



does she want to know about horibai Although I asked a lot of questions, I didn't seem to be able to answer half of them.



"I think she's a bit of a social type. But why ask about horibai? "



" you see, when introducing himself, Mr. horibai left the classroom, right? It seems that I haven't talked to anyone, so I'm a little worried. "



when introducing himself, this person seems to have said that he hopes to be better with the whole class.



"I know what you mean, but I met her only yesterday, so I can't help you. "



" well This is so. I thought you must be former classmates or old friends. I'm sorry to ask you something strange. "



" no, it doesn't matter. Just, why do you know my name? "



" why Didn't you introduce yourself? I have a good memory. "



it seems that CTTB is listening to my hopeless self introduction.



I always think that in this way, I am already very happy.



"Please give me more advice again, Aya koji. "



she reached out to me. Although I was a little confused, I rubbed my hand on my trousers and then held her hand.



"Please give me more advice "



something lucky may happen today. Since there are bad things, there will be good things.



But the human is one kind follows own convenience the biology, therefore the bad matter always can easily cover the past.

as a result, I only peeped at the student canteen a little, so I went to the convenience store to buy bread and went back to the classroom.



There are about ten students who stay in the classroom, including those who eat at the same table with friends, and those who eat alone and quietly. If we want to point out the common point, it is because of the accommodation of all, so almost all of us eat the Bento of super business or student restaurant.



I was about to start eating by myself, but the next door neighbor came back first.



Where did she buy that on her desk? Horibai is eating a delicious sandwich.



Because she was full of the "don't talk to me" breath, I didn't particularly talk to her and sat back in my seat.



After I sat down, as I chewed the sweet bread, music came from the radio.



"Starting at 5:00 this afternoon, there will be a club presentation in the first gymnasium. Students interested in the club, please gather at the first gymnasium. Again. Today -



the voice of a lovely woman comes out on the radio.



A club? I haven't joined the club yet.



"Hello, horibai --"



"I'm not interested in the club. "



"…… I haven't asked you anything. "



" so what do you want to say? "



" are you not a member of Horiba club? "



" are you dementia? Or just a fool? I replied from the beginning that I was not interested. "



" even if you are not interested, it doesn't mean you won't join the club. "



" that's called persuasion. You'd better remember it well. "



" I will "



horibei is not interested in making friends or clubs. I must have bored her by talking to her like this. Does she go to this school just to get into school or get a job?



If it's going to a higher school, it's not unimaginable, but it's a pity.



"You really don't have any friends. I'm so sorry. You're the only one I've been able to talk to so far. Let me start by saying that you don't count me as your friend. "



" Oh, well "



" so, if you want to see a club, what club are you going to join? "



" ah, no, I haven't started to think. But I don't think so. "



" don't plan to join the club, but want to go to the explanation meeting. It's strange. Or do you use the club as an excuse and actually plan to make friends? "



why is this guy so keen. No, it's just me. You understand?



"For me, who failed on the first day, I think the only chance left is the club. It's not good to invite people other than me. "



" it's because I don't have invited people that I'm so upset! "



" it makes sense. However, I don't think
