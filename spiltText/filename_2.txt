yesterday. We’re all in agreement: There’s definitely something strange going on.

“No offense, but Princess Alexia is way out of your league. If she said yes to me? I’d still think it was fishy. Right?”

That’s Skel, the second son of the Baron Etal. He’s slim and tall, and though it seems he cares about his outer appearance, he has zero style. If you look at him from far away, he could trick you into thinking he’s hot. Erm, maybe not. I take that back.

Either way, Princess Alexia is way out of Skel Etal’s league, too. I know this for a fact, because I consider him my “minor character” friend.

“If Cid’s good enough for her, I bet I would’ve been good enough, too. Gah, I really should have confessed to her earlier.”

That’s Po, the second son of the Baron Tato. He’s short and somewhat stocky. You know how there’s one potato-esque guy on every baseball team? That’s basically him.

It doesn’t matter if you look at him from afar, from up close, or from any and all angles. With his looks, he could never scam anyone into thinking he’s cool. It goes without saying that he has absolutely no chance with Princess Alexia. After all, he’s your cold, hard background character.

Oh, and by the way, my name’s Cid. When I’m playing the part of Cid Kagenou, I’m also playing the part of your average Joe.

“To be honest, it’s terrible. I have a feeling she’s got an ulterior motive, which freaks me out. Plus, we basically live in two totally different worlds.”

“Yeah, I hear you. And unlike me, you’re not blessed in the looks department. I’d give it a week before she calls it quits.”

“Three days. Just look around you.”

I scan the cafeteria and see everyone whispering and observing me.

“Over there! That’s…”

“You’re kidding! He’s super average…”

“It must be some kind of mix-up…”

“Oh, I think he’s pretty cute…”

“No way!”

Et cetera.

“I heard he blackmailed her…according to Skel Etal.”

“I’ll kill that son of a bitch…”

“And make it look like an accident during practice…”

“If I don’t do it now, I’d bring shame to mankind…”

And the like.

I’ve got pretty good ears, and I’d caught almost all their chatter. I take a moment to glare at Skel.

“Hmm? What’s up?”

“Nothing.”

I guess friendships between minor characters can be fickle and fleeting.

“But seriously, what do I do? It’d be weird if I mentioned breaking up when I just confessed my love for her.”

And it would break character to dump a princess—though I guess people in this role wouldn’t date them in the first place.

“Come on, give it a try. If you’re lucky, you might make some nice memories,” Skel encourages with a sly grin.

“He’s right. Let’s say this is all a misunderstanding. You still get to date a princess. Don’t waste your time dealing with bullies,” Po adds.

“It doesn’t work that way.”

Even as we waste time now, rumors about me will continue to circulate around the school—meaning I’m getting pushed further and further away from my existence as an average nobody.

“But now that you two are actually going out,” Po muses, “you’ve gotta stay quiet about losing that game.”

“Yeah. I can see things getting messy if word got out. Please don’t say anything. I’m looking at you, Skel.”

“Me? I’d never say anything!”

“I’m serious.”

I sigh as I reach for my daily lunch for broke aristocrats—which costs exactly 980 zeni. I’m starting to get annoyed by the vibe of this place. I’m just going to eat as quickly as possible and skedaddle out of here.

Erm, well, that was the plan.

But a group of maids set the lunch course of the super-duper filthy rich—which costs a whopping ten thousand zeni—in the seat across from me with marked efficiency.

“Is this seat available?”

Enter Alexia. Ugh, I knew she was here. That’s why I was trying to scarf down my lunch.

“P-p-pwease do!”

“Y-y-you can sit here! It’s our pleasure!”

Skel and Po respond, basically shriveling into nothing. These are the same guys who were talking big game about how they could date her if they wanted to. Yep, just as expected of my friends.

“Yeah, sure. Go ahead,” I say to Princess Alexia, who’s waiting for my answer.

“I don’t mind if I do,” she replies, taking a seat.

“Nice weather we’re having.” It seems like an obvious way to fill the silence.

“Indeed.”

Our innocuous conversation continues, and with the elegant movement of her hand, she starts eating her extravagant lunch.

“There’s so much food in the super-duper filthy-rich lunch course.”

“Yeah. I can never finish it.”

“What a waste.”

“I would be fine buying a cheaper lunch, but if I don’t get the expensive one, the others might feel too shy to ask for it.”

“Uh-huh, I see. Can I eat your leftovers?”

“Yes, but…”

“Oh, don’t worry about
