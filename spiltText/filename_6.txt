adult who can keep his work and private life separate.

And then there’s the royal pain in my ass.

“That jerkwad pisses me off. Thinks he’s all that just because he’s all right with a sword.”

Alexia acts nice to his face, but behind closed doors, she’s a foulmouthed tornado.

“Uh-huh, yup. Whatever you say.”

I’ve turned into a yes machine. By this point, I know disagreeing only wastes time.

“Pooch, I’m guessing you saw his fake-ass grin, too.”

“Yep, yep. I saw it all right.”

We’re on our way home after school.

Of late, we’ve gotten into the habit of taking a small detour down a quiet path through the forest on the way back to her dorm. I spend the whole time yessing her and seldom retain more than 10 percent of our conversations.

It’s sunset as we walk at an excruciatingly slow pace down the road. It should take ten minutes to walk its entirety, but it always takes us half an hour.

There are days it takes so long that the stars come out, but I keep my cool. There are days when I feel like telling her to talk to a brick wall, but I show some self-restraint then, too.

Patience, patience, patience. But there’s one thing I feel I have to say.

“Hey, can I ask you something?”

“What is it, Fido?” Alexia sits on her favorite stump and crosses her legs.

Don’t just sit there. Let’s get a move on, I don’t say as I sit down beside her.

“What don’t you like about Mr. Zenon? Objectively speaking, he seems like a home run of a husband.”

“Have you been listening to me at all?” Alexia asks, slightly vexed. “I hate everything about him. His very existence.”

“I mean, he’s a hot expert swordsman with titles, prestige, money—not to mention a good work-life balance and personality. And he’s popular with the ladies.”

Alexia snorts. “Yeah, on the surface. Anyone could pretend. Take me, for an example.”

“Wow, I’m suddenly completely convinced.”

Now that she mentions it, she’s super-popular because she’s the master at wearing a mask in front of others.

“That’s why I don’t judge people by their looks.”

“Then what do you look at?”

“Their flaws.” Alexia smiles smugly.

“What a negative approach. It suits you perfectly.”

“Why, thank you. And just so you know, I don’t mind you, even though you’ve got nothing going for you.”

“Thanks. I’ve never received a compliment that’s made me feel worse.”

Alexia chuckles dryly. “You’re scum through and through, and I like it that way. It’s also why I can’t stand our instructor.”

“What are his flaws?”

“He doesn’t seem to have any.”

“Sounds like a keeper.”

“I told you before: Perfect people don’t exist. I bet he’s either a big fat liar or totally messed up in the head.”

“I see. Thanks for that totally arbitrary and biased answer.”

“You’re welcome, my flawed pooch. Now fetch!” Alexia tosses a coin into the air, and I scramble to retrieve it.

Whoo-hoo! Another ten thousand zeni. I’m gonna catch ’em all.

I shove the coin in my pocket and return to Alexia, who’s clapping her hands in delight.

“Good doggy.” She rubs my head.

Patience, I tell myself.

“Ooh, you hate this so much,” she observes as she vigorously tousles my hair.

I take this opportunity to remember she’s the worst.

“I can see the disgust in your face,” Alexia notes.

“I’m letting you see it.”

She giggles and gets up. “All right. Let’s head home.”

“Yep, yep.”

“And, Fido, note that I’m going to lodge my wooden sword into that damned instructor’s face tomorrow. Make sure you’re watching.”

This compels me to ask another question.

“Would you seriously do that?”

“What do you mean?” she replies, turning back to glare at me.

I think I’m butting into something when I should stay in my lane. But I can’t let this slide.

“Mr. Zenon is definitely stronger than you but not to the point where you wouldn’t be able to fight back.”

I like the way she handles her sword. Her skills evolve every day with her efforts, one step at a time. But in an actual fight, there would be too many extra movements. I would hate to see it sully her swordsmanship, especially since I think it’s good.

“You make it sound so easy. Even though you’re the one wearing white.”

“Don’t mind me. It’s just the ramblings of a white coat.”

“Fine, I’ll let you know the truth. It’s not as easy as you think.”

“Hmm?”

“I have no talent. I was born with a significant amount of magical energy, and I’ve worked hard to get to this point. I think I’m all right now, but I know I don’t stand a chance against a true genius.”

“Maybe.”

“I’ve always been compared to my older sister, Iris. Everyone expected great things from me. And more importantly, I respected Iris and wanted to be at her level. But I realized I’ll never be as good as her. I mean,
