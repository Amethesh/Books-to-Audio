yet.

“Ah, h-hey, look…look out!” I shouted—or tried to, anyway. I’d barely spoken aloud in over a decade, and my already-weak vocal cords had further tightened due to the pain in my ribs and the chill of the rain. All I could muster was a pathetic, wavering squeak that was lost in the din of the downpour.

I knew I had to help them; at the same time, I didn’t know how. I knew that if I didn’t save them, five minutes later I’d wind up regretting it. Like, I was pretty sure seeing three teenagers splattered into paste by a truck moving at terrific speeds was something I’d regret.

Better to save them. I had to do something.

In all likelihood, I’d end up dead on the side of the road, but I figured that, if nothing else, having a bit of solace wouldn’t be so bad. I didn’t want to spend my final moments mired in regret.

I staggered as I started to run. Ten-plus years of barely moving made my legs slow to respond. For the first time in my life, I wished I’d exercised more. My busted ribs sent a startling jolt of pain through me, threatening to bring me to a halt. For the first time in my life, I also wished I’d gotten more calcium.

Even so, I ran. I was capable of running.

The boy who’d been yelling noticed the truck approaching and drew the girl close to him. The other boy had looked away and hadn’t spotted the truck yet. I grabbed him by the collar and yanked him behind me with all my might, then pushed him out of the vehicle’s path.

Good. Now that left the other two.

At that very instant, I saw the truck right before me. I’d simply tried to pull the first boy to safety, but instead, I’d bodily switched places with him, putting me in harm’s way. But that was unavoidable, and had nothing to do with the fact that I weighed over a hundred kilos; running at full speed, I’d simply stumbled a bit too far.

The instant before the truck made contact, a light blossomed behind me. Was I about to see my life flash before my eyes, like people said? It only lasted a moment, so I couldn’t tell. It was all so fast.

Maybe that’s what happens when your life is hollow and half-lived.

I was struck by a truck more than fifty times my weight and thrown against a concrete wall. “Hurgh!” The air was forced from my lungs, which were still spasming for oxygen
