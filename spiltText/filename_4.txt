an outsider, it probably looked like I was just playing around and having fun. In reality, I was locked inside my shell with nothing else to do during my time alone.

No. In retrospect, that was just another excuse. I probably would have been better off deciding I wanted to be a manga artist and posting a silly little web comic online, or deciding I wanted to be a light novel author and serializing stories, or something like that. There were plenty of people in circumstances like mine who did that sort of thing.

Those were the people I made fun of.

“This stuff is crap,” I’d snort derisively upon viewing their creations, acting like it was my place to be a critic when I hadn’t done anything myself.

 

I wanted to go back to school—ideally to grade school, or maybe junior high. Hell, even going back a year or two would be fine. If I had a little more time, I’d be able to do something. I might have half-assed everything I’d ever done, but I could pick up where I’d left off. If I really applied myself, I could be a pro at something, even if I didn’t wind up the best at it.

Like manga or writing. Maybe video games or programming. Whichever the case, with the proper effort, I could have gotten results, and from there, I could have made money and—

No. It didn’t matter now. I hadn’t made the effort. Even if I could go back to the past, I’d only trip up again, stopped in my tracks by some similar obstacle. I hadn’t made it through things that normal people managed to breeze through without thinking, and that’s why I was where I was now.

Suddenly, amidst the downpour, I heard people arguing. “Hm?” I muttered. Was someone having a fight? That wasn’t good. I didn’t want to get involved with that sort of thing. Even as I was thinking that, however, my feet kept carrying me in that direction.

“Look, you’re the one who—”

“No, you’re the one who—”

What I saw when I rounded the corner were three high schoolers in the midst of what was clearly
