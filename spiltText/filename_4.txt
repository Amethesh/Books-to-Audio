we’d wave our swords for a few seconds and play-fight the whole time. It’s nice to see the strongest fighters value their fundamentals. Plus, all the students are skilled. I can say it’s a neat environment—and I’m not trying to suck up or anything.

And most importantly, the techniques taught in this class are hyper-logical. It feels great to take part in training that doesn’t leave me bored out of my mind.

“Do ya like the Royal Bushin method?” Our hunky blond instructor approaches me.

I think his name is Zenon Griffey.

“Does it seem that way?”

“Yeah, you look like you’re enjoying yourself.”

“I guess I am.”

Mr. Zenon grins in an easy-breezy type of way. “As you know, the Royal Bushin method is a relatively new fighting style, a deviation from traditional Bushin. There was some resistance at first between the traditional supporters and the trailblazers. But thanks to Princess Iris, it’s now being recognized as the artistic heir of its traditional counterpart.”

“And I hear you’re one of the swordsmen who’s spread the art throughout the country, Mr. Zenon.”

“Yeah, but my contributions are nothing compared to Princess Iris’s. In any case, the Royal Bushin method practically raised me, which is why it makes me happy to see others enjoying it, too. Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt you.”

With that, Mr. Zenon goes to check in on the other students. I totally understand his feelings. I mean, I get all giddy when Alpha and the other girls watch me show off my swordplay. I’ve developed these techniques on my own, which makes me all the more excited when others take them on, too.

“What did you two talk about?” Alexia asks.

“The Royal Bushin method.”

“Hmm. We’re going to spar next. Let’s pair up.”

Sparring is basically a form of light training where we review techniques, reversals, and battle processes without actually hitting our opponent.

“Aren’t you too strong for me?”

“It’ll be fine.”

We pick up our wooden swords and start exchanging blows.

I swing, and she blocks.

She strikes, and I guard.

We don’t hit each other, moving at a sluggish pace, and skimp on magical energy. All around us, the other pairs are locked head-to-head in all-out fights, blasting each other with spells. But to my surprise, Alexia is matching my pace.

No. That’s not it… This is normal for her. After all, the purpose of this activity is to review our strategies, meaning that speed and power are pointless. Alexia is focused on this goal—and that alone. I can tell by the way she handles her sword.

This entire country sings the praises of Princess Iris, Alexia’s older sister—brilliant and fiendish, the strongest combatant in the kingdom. On the other hand, they don’t have much to say about Alexia. She possesses magic and forthright techniques, but she’s inferior to her sister. That’s what people generally say when talking about Alexia.

But as I spar with her, I think she’s good. She adheres to the basics and grasps the foundations of combat, though it feels uninspired.

Yeah, it’s run-of-the-mill. But that’s the fruit of her labor: Her swordplay is polished, refined, and devoid of all excess. That’s the proof that she’s mastered the basics step-by-step.

Delta, you could learn a thing or two from her, I think, engaging in a fake conversation with a certain hybrid beast—one whose swordsmanship I find hard to forgive.

“Your swordplay isn’t bad,” Alexia notes.

“Thanks.”

“But I don’t like it.”

She likes lifting me up to bring me down.

“It’s like I’m watching myself fight. Let’s stop here for today.”

She begins packing up, leaving it at that. Class is over.

Never in my wildest dreams did I expect to get through this elective without a hitch. If I can just get my stuff together, change, and book it to my dorm room, I might be able to…

“Hold it.”

My bubble bursts.

Alexia drags me by the nape of my neck.

“This is your answer, I’m guessing,” observes Mr. Zenon, who’s standing in front of me for some reason.

“I’ve decided to go out with him.”

“You can’t keep running forever,” he warns, narrowing his eyes.

“I’m just a kid. This situation is too grown-up for me,” Alexia replies, following it with a pompous burst of laughter.

This is enough for me to figure out how I could get into this section and why she’s chosen to go out with me. Watching their cutscene play out and melting into the background, I pray these two protagonists won’t drag me into their drama.





“I know that Mr. Zenon is your fiancé and that you’re pushing the onus on me.” I confront Alexia after school behind the academic building.

“He’s not my fiancé, just one of the suitors,” Alexia corrects, looking all calm and composed.

“It’s the same thing.”

“It’s not.
