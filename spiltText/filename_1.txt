Volume 1 Class D



On the second day of school, as it was the first day of class, most of the class only made learning policies and other instructions.



The teachers are so cheerful and friendly that people don't think it's a school for entering a higher school. Many students are disappointed in their actual feelings. Even Xuteng has put on the appearance of a great man, sleeping in almost every class. Although the teacher noticed, he didn't want to admonish him at all.



Listening or not is a personal freedom, so the teacher will not interfere. Is this the corresponding way for non compulsory high school students?



In a relaxed atmosphere into the lunch break. The students left the table, went out to eat with the people they knew. I can only look at the scene with envy. Unfortunately, in the end, I didn't even have half of my classmates who seemed to get better.



"How sad. "



another single person noticed my situation and gave me a look of ridicule.



"Why, what sorrow? "



" I really want to be invited and have dinner with whom - because I see through your ideas. "



" you are also a person, don't you think so? Or are you going to be alone without friends for three years? "



" yes, I prefer a person. "



horibai replied quickly without any confusion. I can hear that from the bottom of my heart.



"Leave me alone, but do you think of some way for your situation? "



" yes "



If I can't make good friends with my friends, I really can't say such a thing on my own.



To be honest, if you don't make friends like this, you will be in trouble later. Because being isolated can also become conspicuous. If you become a bully, you will be miserable.



Only a minute after the class ended, about half of the students in the class disappeared.



The rest of the students, like me, who would like to go with someone, but they are timid. There are also people who didn't realize this kind of thing from the beginning, or like horibei who likes to go alone.



"Er - I want to go to the student restaurant next. Is there anyone to go with me? "



Hirata said that as soon as he stood up.



I'm quite impressed by this guy's thinking loop, or the posture of the life victory group. And somewhere in my heart, I may be looking forward to the Savior who makes this opportunity.



Hirata, I'll go now. I'm determined and ready to slowly raise my hand



"I'm going to &" 12316;! "I want it, too! I want it, too! "



as soon as I saw the girls gathered around Hirata, I put down the hand I was trying to lift.



Why do girls raise their hands! That's what Hirata showed to the single boy! Even if he is a little handsome, don't even follow him for dinner!



"What a tragedy. "



horibai's vision changed from ridicule to contempt.



"Don't judge others' hearts without permission! "



" is there anyone else? "



maybe it was a little lonely because there was no boy. Hirata looked around.



Hirata's eyes moved in the classroom, and then, of course, met with my eyes as a boy.



This way! Hirata, pay attention to me! The man who is looking forward to your invitation is here!



And I on the eye of Hirata, did not look away.



It's worthy of being a life winning group who takes care of the class. Does he understand my request!



"Er - Aya small --"



in Hirata, it seems that in order to respond to me, the moment when I want to call my name --



"let's go, Hirata. "



a hot girl didn't notice me, so she grabbed Hirata's arm.



Ah Hirata's eyes were taken away by the girls. Then, Hirata and the girls came out of the classroom in harmony. All I have left are my hands hanging in the air and my body standing in the air.



To this kind of state, I always feel a little ashamed, then pretend to grasp the head and muddle through.



"I'll go first. "



horibai left a compassionate sight and walked out of the classroom alone.



"Vacuum is empty "



I had no choice but to leave my seat alone, so I decided to go to the student restaurant.



If the atmosphere doesn't allow me to eat alone, go to the convenience store and buy something.



"You are Ling Xiaolu's classmate Am I right? "



I was about to go to the student restaurant when I was stopped by a beautiful girl. It's chlota in the class.



Because it's the first time to face like this, my heart is pounding.



Her hair is a little shorter from the shoulder Brown straight hair. It's not a dirty image, but she wears the skirt to the shortest length allowed by the school, full of the feeling of the recent high school girls. The make-up bag in her hand is hung with many key rings. I can't tell if she's carrying her make-up bag or the key ring.



"I'm a member of the same class. Do you remember me? "



" probably remember, what can I do for you? "



" actually I want
