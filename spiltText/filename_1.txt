Volume 1 Class D



On the second day of school, as it was the first day of class, most of the class only made learning policies and other instructions.



The teachers are so cheerful and friendly that people don't think it's a school for entering a higher school. Many students are disappointed in their actual feelings. Even Xuteng has put on the appearance of a great man, sleeping in almost every class. Although the teacher noticed, he didn't want to admonish him at all.



Listening or not is a personal freedom, so the teacher will not interfere. Is this the corresponding way for non compulsory high school students?



In a relaxed atmosphere into the lunch break. The students left the table, went out to eat with the people they knew. I can only look at the scene with envy. Unfortunately, in the end, I didn't even have half of my classmates who seemed to get better.
