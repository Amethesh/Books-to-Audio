being polite around me. I mean, this is the section for low-ranking aristocrats.”

Alexia looks baffled as I swipe the meat from her main dish and cram it into my mouth before she can get a word in edgewise.





Oh, it’s good.

“Um…”

“Pass the fish.”

“Wait…!”

Whoo-hoo, it’s my lucky day. Thanks to the princess, I get to fill my stomach, which is blissed the hell out. You might notice that my attitude toward her has changed from yesterday and that I’m acting super-casual around her.

And if you want to know why…

It’s ’cause I’m in the middle of Operation: Get Dumped ASAP!

“Sigh… Sure, whatever.”

“Thanks for the meal. See ya later.”

“Halt!”

Dammit. My plan to dine and dash fails, and I reluctantly slink back to my seat.

“I assume you’re taking Royal Bushin for your practical elective in the afternoon.”

“Yurp.”

The academy requires its students to take general courses in the morning and practical electives in the afternoon. The former takes place in set classrooms, but the latter is a mishmash of students from all classes and grades. We’re basically allowed to choose one of many weapon arts electives that we feel suits us best.

“I’m in that class, too. I thought it’d be nice to take it together.”

“Yeah, no. I mean, you’re in section one. I’m in section nine.”

Bushin arts is so popular that it has nine different sections, with fifty students in each, divided up by skill level. For now, I’m performing poorly enough to be in section nine, so I can scope things out. I plan to eventually settle for section five.

“No, it’s okay. With my recommendation, I got you into section one.”

“It’s totally not okay. I know that for a fact.”

“Would you rather that I enroll in section nine?”

“No, stop. That’d make me look bad.”

“It’s one or the other. Choose.”

“No.”

“This is a royal order.”

“I’m off to section one.”

With that, lunch is over. Skel and Po were completely still from start to finish, basically melting into the background.





“This place is huge…,” I marvel the moment I step into the classroom for section one. I can’t help myself.

To put it simply, it looks like a ginormous gymnasium. In addition to the standard locker room, it is fully equipped with a shower room, a café, and a maid who opens the entrance, which technically makes it a manually operated automatic door.

As for section nine, we meet outdoors—rain or shine, sleet or snow. There isn’t even a door for a maid to open, much less a maid.

To avoid getting bullied by the other students, I hastily change into my uniform and wait for Alexia in the corner for a while.

“Let’s loosen up,” she suggests as soon as she enters the room in her Bushin uniform.

Think plain cheongsam, one of those tight-fitting dresses you might see in a movie about the 1920s, with a high leg slit. That’s the uniform for girls. Hers is black, which indicates she’s one of the strongest fighters. In Bushin, each color represents a different level of strength: Black is at the top, and white is at the bottom.

I’m in white, obviously. And since I’m the only one in white in this entire room, I stick out like a sore thumb.

I ignore the stares of other students—70 percent hostile, 30 percent curious—and warm up with some light stretches.

“Interesting,” remarks Alexia, mirroring my movements.

In this world, it’s common knowledge that it’s beneficial to loosen your muscles before working out. But with no how-to guides on stretching, everyone does it in their own way. I mean, if you’re a die-hard for sports, you’ll hurt yourself if you don’t stretch properly. I’ve heard of others using magic to force their muscles to loosen up, but this still affects their performance.

Alexia is well versed in that sense, which is nice. I mean, I’m a high-maintenance purist when it comes to battle. Like, I won’t lose to the average pretentious snob.

We’re getting ready when class begins.

“Starting today, we have a new friend joining us,” our instructor starts, introducing me.

“I’m Cid Kagenou. It’s nice to meet you.”

There isn’t a hint of friendliness in my classmates’ eyes.

Ah, section one. A quick glance around, and I can already spot some VIPs. That hot guy over there is the second son of a duke, and that beauty is the daughter of the current leader of the Dark Knights. Then there’s our teacher, who’s the fencing instructor for the country. And on top of that, he’s a young blond hunk who’s only twenty-eight years old.

“Let’s welcome him to our class.”

With that, we start training, suppressing our magic through meditation first before practicing our swings and going over the basics of swordplay.

Nice, nice. I’m all for reviewing the basics. They’re important to know. In section nine,
