He keeps pressing the issue as if it’s a done deal, and it’s stressing me out.”

“That has nothing to do with me. I hate to break it to you, but I have no plans to get sucked into this mess.”

“You’re awfully cold for a lover.”

“A lover? Come on. You just needed a red herring to take the fall for you. Isn’t that right?”

“Fine. But that goes for both of us,” she quips, a devious smile spreading across her face.

“Both of us? What the hell are you talking about?”

“Playing dumb, huh? Mr. I-confessed-to-a-girl-as-a-punishment, Cid Kagenou.” Her grin broadens.

Okay…hold up. Let’s chill out for a sec.

“Oh, to play with the heart and purity of a maiden,” she laments. “How cruel.”

Says the girl without a trace of purity in her entire body. Alexia lets a few fake tears fall from her eyes.

It’s okay. I’m totally calm.

“I have no idea what you’re talking about. Do you have any proof?”

Right, evidence first. As long as the guys didn’t stab me in the back, it won’t matter how suspicious she is of my intentions…

“I think his name’s Po. When I approached him, he turned bright red and blabbed everything, including things I didn’t ask about. Nice friend you’ve got there.”

I imagine myself beating him into a pile of mashed potatoes to regain my mental composure.

“Are you all right? Your cheeks look all puffy.”

“I’m fine. I break into a smile ’cause I’m broken inside.”

“Oh. Huh.”

“But I’m not as bad as you.”

“Hmm? Did you say something?”

“Nothing. What do you want from me…?”

I have no choice but to accept defeat. My fatal flaw is choosing the wrong friends.

“Well…” Alexia crosses her arms and leans against the wall of the academic building. “Let’s keep pretending we’re together for now—until that man gives up.”

“I’m only the son of a baron, you know. I’m not enough to stop him.”

“I know. I just need to buy time. I’ll figure something out.”

“And I don’t want you to put me in harm’s way. I mean, the dude is a master swordsman. If things don’t work out, I’m gonna get my ass handed to me.”

“Stop whining,” Alexia snaps before fishing some coins out of her pocket and scattering them onto the ground. “Pick them up,” she orders.

Each coin is worth ten thousand zeni, and I count at least ten on the floor.

“What? Do I look like I’d be swayed by cash?” I ask from all fours, carefully retrieving the coins one by one.

“You do.”

“You’re damn right.”

Eleven…twelve…thirteen coins… Oh, snap! I found another one!

Just as I extend my hand to collect the last coin, she stomps on the change with her loafer.

I look up at Alexia, and her red eyes bear down on me.

I can see up her pleated skirt.

“Are you going to do as I say?” she asks with a grin that oozes wickedness.

“Of course.” I smile from ear to ear.

“Good dog.”

Alexia pats my head before briskly walking away with her short skirt billowing behind her. I wipe her footprint from the coin and gently place it in my pocket.





Even as I attend the academy, I continue cutting down on sleep to keep training, but this fake courtship with Alexia is really sucking up my time.

“Come with me.”

With this order, I’m dragged into the classroom for section-one students in the Royal Bushin elective at the wee hours of the morning. We’re the only ones here. The sun is streaming into the room, and it’s peaceful.

It’s time for morning practice.

Alexia swings her sword, and I follow suit next to her.

She’s very serious when it comes to practice. It’s the one thing I don’t mind about her. We never speak, just practice in absolute silence, and I’m not annoyed about spending time with her—for once in my life.

“Your swordplay is strange,” Alexia comments. “You’ve got the basics down. That’s it, but…” She pauses.

I’m obviously subduing my strength, magic, and abilities as I slice through the air. Which leaves me with the fundamentals.

“…But I can’t take my eyes off it.”

“Thanks.”

I can hear the birds chirping outside, but I know they aren’t whistling a tune to themselves. It’s a war cry to claim their territory, which means they’re really duking it out.

“But I still don’t like it,” Alexia adds.

We don’t speak after that. We just keep practicing.





Two more weeks pass, and I’m somehow managing to survive as Alexia’s “boyfriend.”

Every once in a while, the other students will bully me, but it’s nothing I can’t handle. I’m just relieved Mr. Zenon hasn’t beaten the living shit out of me or availed himself of any quick and savage tricks to erase me from existence.

In fact, Mr. Zenon is polite to the two of us during class, instructing us as if he and I don’t have beef with each other. He doesn’t approach me to shoot the breeze anymore, but I would say he’s a proper
