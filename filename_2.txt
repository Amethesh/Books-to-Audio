reshing. I'm almost asleep.



However, the calm mood disappeared immediately.



"Don't you think you should make way for your seat? "



I was shocked for a moment and opened my eyes, which were almost closed.



Eh, can't I be scolded?



I think so, but the person being advised seems to be a man sitting a little ahead.



Sitting in the fraternity seat, he was a big young blonde - a high school student, to say. Just now, the old woman was standing on his right side, and there was a woman in the style of ol.



"Don't you, who is sitting there, see that grandma is bothered? "



women with ol style seem to want him to give up his philanthropic seat to the old lady.



Ol's voice clearly spread through the quiet car, naturally attracting the eyes of the surrounding.



"It's a crazy question, lady. "



I think teenagers should be angry or ignore, otherwise they are obedient, but the result is not right. The young man grinned and began to cross his legs again.



"Why do I have to give up my seat to this old lady? There's no reason at all. "



" the seat you're sitting in is the fraternity seat, of course, to the elderly? "



" I can't understand. Even if it is a philanthropist, there is no legal obligation to give up his seat. Whether or not to move at this time is up to me who has this seat at present. Young people have to give way? Ha ha ha! It's really the idea of nonsense. "



it's really not the way high school students talk. Even the hair is dyed blonde, which makes me feel out of place.



"I'm a healthy young man. It's not inconvenient to stand, but it's obviously more physical than sitting. I'm not going to do such useless things meaninglessly. Or will you give me tip? "



" here This is the attitude of speaking to the elders! "



" elder? You and the old lady have lived a longer life than me, which is very clear and undoubted. But the so-called senior refers to people with higher status. And you also have a problem. Even if there is an age gap, don't you have a very arrogant and arrogant attitude? "



" what! Are you a high school student? Please listen to me when you talk! "



" OK Ok "



OL was furious, but the old lady didn't seem willing to make things bigger. She placates ol with gestures. However, she seems to be full of fire after being insulted by high school students.



"It seems that the old lady is more reasonable than you. Alas, there are still some values in Japanese society. Sing for the rest of your life. "



the young man showed an inexplicable bright smile, then put on the earphone with loud noise and began to listen to the music. The ol, who plucked up the courage to make suggestions, seemed to gnash his teeth.



Being shut up by someone younger than yourself in a way that is basically tough sophistry. The self righteous attitude of the youth must have made her quite angry.



Even so, she didn't reply because she had to agree with the teenager.



In fact, there is no obligation to abdicate if moral issues are eliminated.



"I'm sorry "



ol fought back tears and apologized to the old woman in a low voice.



It was an accident in the bus. To be honest, I was relieved not to be involved. It doesn't matter how the old people are not allowed to take their seats.



In the end, the young people who carried out themselves marked the end of victory. Just when everyone in the room thinks so --



"that I think my elder sister is right. "



there was an unexpected rescue. The master of the voice seems to be standing by the ol, seemingly determined to speak to the youth with courage. It's a man in my school uniform.



"Is this a pretty girl? It seems that today I have an unexpected heterosexual relationship. "



" from just now on, the old mother-in-law has been looking very uncomfortable. Could you please let your seat out? Well, maybe I'm too nosy, but I think it can also be regarded as a contribution to society. "



the teenager" snapped his fingers.



"Social contribution? So it's quite an interesting idea. Abdication to the elderly is indeed a part of social contribution. But unfortunately, I'm not interested in social contribution. I think it's enough to satisfy myself. What's more, in such a crowded car, although I have become the target of public criticism in the seat of philanthropy, it's OK to put the other people who are indifferent to themselves and don't speak a word and depend on their seats? If there is the idea of cherishing the elderly, I think whether it's a philanthropist or not, it's just a small thing. "



the idea of a young girl has not been conveyed. From the beginning to the end, the young girl does not change her aboveboard attitude. Neither ol nor the old woman could answer back, but they were reluctant to do so.



However, the young girls who face the young people are not discouraged.
