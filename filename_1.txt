Volume 1 Welcome To The Dreamlike Campus Life



"Aya path, can you excuse me? "



here comes my fear.



The guy came to me as if nothing had happened.



The devil came to awaken me who was facing the inner and social conditions.



"Symphony No. 11" by Xiao Shita and Gao Weiqi came to my mind. Now, I am very suitable for this song, which shows people being chased, fleeing by demons, and declaring the despair of the end of the world.



Even if I close my eyes, I can feel that the devil standing next to me is eager to see the awakening of slaves, and the extraordinary atmosphere it sends out So, as a slave, how can I break this situation



In order to avoid danger, I run my brain at full speed and deduce the answer instantly.



The conclusion is I decided to pretend I didn't hear it, and I named it the "sleep" operation. Use this trick.



If you are a gentle girl, you should say "really, really can't help it. It's too pitiful to wake you up, let you go" and let me go.



Or " If you don't get up, kiss me. Look! "This mode is OK.



"In three seconds from now, if you don't declare that you are awake, I will punish you. "



"…… What are sanctions! "



the interval is less than one second, and the operation of sleep is detected. I succumbed to the threat of force.



Even if I don't raise my head, it's my only resistance.



"Look, I'm awake. "



" I've learned enough that it's terrible to make you angry. "



" good. So can I take up some of your time? "



"…… What if I said no? "



" let me think Although you have no right to refuse, I should be very unhappy. "Next, this guy went on to say:



" if I become unhappy, the campus life of Ayana will also cause great obstacles in the future. By the way, for example, countless pushpins are placed on the chair, water is poured from the top after entering the toilet, or needles are sometimes pricked by compasses, and so on. "



" it's just harassment No, isn't this bullying! And in the end, should that be particularly true? I remember being stabbed! "



I can't help but stand up from lying on the table.



On the right side, the girl with black hair and beautiful and sharp eyes is looking down at me.



Her name is Horie North ringtone. I am a classmate of class D in senior high school.



"Don't worry. I was just kidding. I won't pour you water right above. "



" the key point is that the pushpin and the compass part! Look at this! There are still traces of being stabbed! If become permanent scar, how do you plan to be responsible? You say ah! "



I rolled up my right sleeve and stretched out the stabbed upper arm to hori Bei's eyes.



"What about the evidence? "



" eh? "



" so what about the evidence? Are you sure I'm a prisoner when you don't have any evidence? "



I do not have evidence. Within the distance of needling me, there is only hori Bei in the neighborhood. It's hard to say that it's decisive evidence that horibai is adjusting the compasses after being stabbed around



But compared with this, I still have something to confirm.



"Do you really have to help? I tried to reconsider, but still - "



" Hello, Aya koji. Which do you like better, regretting while suffering, or regretting while despairing? You forced me back before, because of this, of course, I have to take responsibility. Right? "



Horiba's unreasonable alternative question is put in front of him. It seems that the thief ship will not be allowed. It's my mistake to make a contract with this devil. I decided to give up and submit to her.



"…… So, what on earth should I do? What else should I do? "



I asked gingerly. I'm not surprised by what I've been asked to do.



Really, why is it like this? ——Even if I don't want to, I can't help thinking about it again.



My meeting with this girl happened to be two months ago from now on. That's the day of the entrance ceremony



1



April. Entrance ceremony. I was on the bus to school, shaking with the car. As I spent my time looking out of the window at the street view changes, the number of bus passengers increased.



The passengers in the same car were almost young people in high school uniforms.



When I found out, I almost misunderstood the crowding level in the car. Would those office workers who were chased by work and full of frustration be about to commit the act of sex wolf.



The old lady standing not far ahead of me, now she seems to be on the verge of falling down, which makes people feel very dangerous. But since we know it's such a rate, but we still need to get on the bus, it's self inflicted.



For me, who is lucky enough to make sure of my seat, all this support has nothing to do with me.



Let me forget the sympathetic old woman, waiting for her destination in a fresh and clear mood.



Today, it's sunny and ref
