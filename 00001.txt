Volume 1 Japan'S Social Structure

It's very sudden, but I'd like you to listen to my questions a little bit and try to think about the answers.

Is everyone equal?

Today's real society calls for "equality and equality".

There is often a call for gender parity and a desperate effort to eliminate the differences.

"Raise the employment rate of women" and "set up special carriages for women" - sometimes even the order of the rosters is nitpicking.

As there should be no discrimination, even the word "handicapped", public opinion also advocates changing the wording to "handicapped". Today's children are also instilled with the idea that everyone is equal.

Is this really right? ——I'm so skeptical.

Men and women have different abilities and responsibilities. No matter how seriously you want to express yourself, it will not change the fact that you are physically and mentally handicapped. There's no point in not looking straight.

In other words, the answer is No. Human beings are unequal creatures and existence. There is no equal human being.

In the past, a great man once said that heaven did not create man on man, nor did he create man on man. However, this is not about equality.

That's right. You should know that there is a continuation of this famous saying?

This is how it continues.
